## Government Policies and Incentives for Renewable Energy

The United Kingdom is making significant strides toward a sustainable future by requiring that nearly all new buildings in England be equipped with solar panels. This mandate is a cornerstone of the Future Homes Standard, set to take effect in 2025. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has highlighted the critical role these regulations play in enhancing the country's energy efficiency. This initiative is not just a win for the solar industry but also a triumph for environmental advocates, ensuring that solar panels will be a common feature in 90% of new homes. These installations could lead to savings of up to £530 annually for families, considering current energy prices.

As it stands, domestic installations account for only 31% of the UK's photovoltaic capacity, a decrease observed after the termination of the feed-in tariff in 2019. Nonetheless, interest in solar panels has climbed in the period leading to April 2025. The mandate, in tandem with the government's housing acceleration efforts, could greatly augment rooftop solar capacity. Despite encountering obstacles, as indicated by the Office for Budget Responsibility with plans to build 1.5 million homes by 2029, planned reforms aim to peak housing construction by March 2025. Miliband characterizes the Future Homes Standard as igniting a "rooftop revolution," extending beyond solar panels to include guidelines for low-carbon heating solutions like heat pumps.

Globally, financial incentives such as tax credits are pivotal in advancing renewable energy technologies by providing financial relief and reducing initial project costs. These incentives level the playing field between clean energy solutions and fossil fuels. In the United States, federal tax credits, grants, and loan programs are significant for supporting renewable energy projects. Programs like the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit, the Investment Tax Credit, the Residential Energy Credit, and the Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System are part of this support, complemented by agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Yet, projections suggest a decline in new solar installations in the U.S. over the next five years. This is due to a federal policy shift favoring fossil fuels and tariffs that increase solar project costs. Forecasts from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie predict a reduction in new solar capacity, potentially over 10% less in 2030 than in 2025, primarily driven by the projected cessation of clean energy tax credits.

Policy changes in the U.S., including alterations to federal permitting and the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives, are reshaping the landscape for renewable energy projects. Executive orders under the current administration suggest a prioritization of domestic fossil fuel production, which could impact the pace of renewable energy progress. However, the U.S. has also launched initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, extending federal incentives for renewable energy projects on potentially contaminated lands, in line with state and local incentives tracked in the DSIRE database.

Recent studies emphasize the essential role of renewable energy subsidies in promoting global adoption of clean technologies, highlighting their capability to counteract fossil fuel impacts. Rapid expansion of renewables is linked to effective policy strategies worldwide, with subsidies being a critical motivator. Research employing a two-stage behavioral model suggests that to maximize their effectiveness, subsidies should adapt to evolving circumstances.
