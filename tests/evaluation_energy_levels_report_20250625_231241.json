          "score": 4,
          "explanation": "The section demonstrates strong logical progression with smooth transitions between topics. It moves from dietary recommendations to specific supplements, culminating in a holistic approach to energy boosting. The flow from one paragraph to the next is coherent, although the introduction could connect a bit more directly with the core focus on natural energy boosters."
        },
        "integration_quality": {
          "score": 3,
          "explanation": "The section includes references to studies and reviews, but specific citations (e.g., [11]) lack context here, making it difficult to assess the integration quality fully. Despite this, the information is generally well blended into a unified narrative."
