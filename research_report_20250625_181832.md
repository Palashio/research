The company prioritizes technological innovation and customer-driven value creation across domains such as mono silicon wafers, solar cells and modules, commercial and industrial solar solutions, green energy provisions, and hydrogen equipment. LONGi continues to champion the global zero-carbon movement through robust and effective energy solutions [7].

Meanwhile, NREL is investigating solar-plus-storage technology, exploring how solar advancements can further revolutionize energy systems. By pairing solar photovoltaic systems with energy storage solutions like lithium-ion batteries, NREL examines the deployment and integration benefits for both distributed and utility-scale systems. Such technologies are vital for enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the power grid, promoting solar energy utilization during peak demand periods, and broadening future applications of solar technology [3]. Additionally, projects initiated by the U.S. Department of Energy, such as the Interstate Renewable Energy Council’s (IREC) efforts, aim to tackle interconnection challenges faced by standalone energy storage and solar-plus-storage systems within the distribution grid. These initiatives seek to improve the integration of solar energy into current infrastructure, thereby making solar technology more accessible and effective [4].

## Innovations in Energy Storage Solutions

A remarkable advancement in zinc-ion battery technology has been achieved by researchers at the National Graphene Institute at The University of Manchester and the University of Technology Sydney. Their innovative method utilizes a two-dimensional manganese-oxide/graphene superlattice, which effectively extends the battery's lifespan. This construction introduces a novel lattice-wide strain mechanism, notably enhancing the structural stability of the battery's cathode. The outcome is a zinc-ion battery that remains efficient over 5,000 charge-discharge cycles, showcasing a 50% increase in longevity compared to current models.

Central to this breakthrough is the Cooperative Jahn-Teller Effect (CJTE), where a particular lattice distortion facilitates a stable 1:1 balance of manganese ions, Mn³⁺ and Mn⁴⁺. Incorporated within a two-dimensional structure on graphene, this mechanism establishes a long-range, consistent strain throughout the material, protecting the cathode from degradation even with persistent use. As a result, this innovation leads to a cost-effective, water-based battery that circumvents safety issues often associated with lithium-ion batteries.

Professor Guoxiu Wang, the leader of the research team from the University of Technology Sydney, emphasized the broader implications of their findings. He highlighted the potential to design two-dimensional material heterostructures for scalable uses, transitioning from theoretical explorations to practical device enhancements, such as rechargeable batteries. Zinc-ion batteries, in particular, hold significant promise for stationary storage—crucial for renewable energy usage in both homes and businesses. Traditionally, their limited lifespan has been a constraint, but this development marks a pivotal step forward. Professor Rahul Nair from The University of Manchester pointed out that this achievement marks a new era in strain engineering for two-dimensional materials. By leveraging the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect, researchers are in a position to modify the magnetic, mechanical, and optical properties of materials in groundbreaking ways.

The team further explored scaling their synthesis method, leveraging water-based processes that eliminate toxic solvents and high-temperature requirements. This represents a significant leap toward broader manufacturing feasibility.

Parallel advancements in solid-state energy storage devices are addressing safety concerns commonly associated with liquid-based electrolytes. Two-dimensional materials are exceptionally promising in this context, given their high specific surface area and a wealth of electrochemical active sites. These features significantly enhance the performance of solid-state batteries and supercapacitors. They fulfill a variety of roles, including serving as electrode materials and conductive agents, thus boosting safety and sustainability in energy storage.

At the same time, researchers at Dalhousie University are pushing the boundaries of lithium-ion technology by focusing on single-crystal electrodes. This material offers considerable benefits, enabling lithium-ion batteries to withstand over 20,000 charge-discharge cycles while retaining 80% of their initial capacity. This breakthrough can potentially revolutionize the lifecycle of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, allowing them to be used for grid energy storage after their tenure in vehicles. By investigating the degradation pathways of these single-crystal electrodes, the study provides crucial insights into enhancing battery lifespan and optimizing performance for both transportation and stationary storage.

Moreover, endeavors to innovate in next-generation battery technologies are exploring alternative chemistries like lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries.
